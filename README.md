✨ **What HypeXray does**

HypeXray helps you see the structure of an offer without the emotional pressure.

Paste a sales page, pitch, listing, or DM and HypeXray breaks it into neutral boxes such as:

What’s being offered

Price signals

Timeline and access

Claims and promises

Risks or pressure language

Missing information to ask about

It does not decide for you.
It helps you ask better questions.

🧭 **Common use cases**

1. Evaluating online offers

Use HypeXray before buying:

Courses

Coaching programs

Subscriptions

Services

Freelance proposals

Especially useful when pricing is unclear, urgency is used, or deliverables feel vague.

2. Travel offers and tours

HypeXray works well for:

Tours and excursions

Itineraries

Packages

“DM to book” listings

It helps surface:

What’s included vs excluded

Duration and access terms

Refund rules

Mobility or requirement constraints

Pressure language like “limited spots”

There is a built-in travel offer example in the app.

3. Comparing options calmly

Run multiple offers one by one and copy each snapshot into Notes or a document.

This makes it easier to compare:

Scope

Risk

Missing details

Fit, not urgency

4. Writing clearer offers

If you create offers yourself, paste your own draft to see:

Which parts are concrete

Which parts are vague

What questions buyers may ask next
