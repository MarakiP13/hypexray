# Security Policy

HypeXray is a client-side, privacy-first tool with no backend services.

This document explains how to report security concerns responsibly.

---

## Scope

HypeXray:
- Runs entirely in the browser
- Does not store user data
- Does not transmit pasted text to a server
- Does not require accounts or authentication

Because of this architecture, the security surface area is intentionally small.

---

## Reporting a security issue

If you believe you have found a security issue, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue for active security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, contact:

📧 **[YOUR@email.com]**

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce it
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Browser and device used

Screenshots or short screen recordings are helpful but optional.

---

## What counts as a security issue

Examples:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Code injection risks
- Unexpected external network requests
- PWA or install-related permission abuse
- Anything that compromises user privacy or intent

---

## What does not count as a security issue

- Heuristic or parsing inaccuracies
- Disagreement with analysis output
- Feature requests
- UX or wording concerns

Those belong in normal issues or discussions.

---

## Responsible disclosure

Please allow reasonable time for investigation and resolution before sharing details publicly.

HypeXray is maintained with a focus on calm iteration, not rapid patch cycles.

---

## Final note

HypeXray is designed to reduce risk by staying simple.

If you believe something undermines that principle, it is worth reporting.

Thank you for helping keep the tool safe.
