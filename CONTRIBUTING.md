# Contributing to HypeXray

Thank you for your interest in improving HypeXray.

HypeXray is intentionally simple. Contributions are welcome, but the goal is clarity and calm, not feature accumulation.

**Philosophy**

Client-side first

No backend dependencies

Privacy-respectful by default

Clear over clever

Fewer features, better judgment

If a contribution makes the tool heavier, noisier, or more aggressive, it is unlikely to be accepted.

**Ways to contribute**

1. Report issues

If something feels unclear or broken:

Describe what you pasted

Describe what you expected

Describe what happened instead

Screenshots are welcome but not required.

2. Suggest improvements

**Good suggestions:**

clearer wording

better defaults

edge cases the parser misses

accessibility improvements

mobile UX refinements

Please include:

the problem you’re solving

why it improves clarity

why it should stay client-side

3. Code contributions

If you submit a pull request:

Keep it small and focused

Avoid adding libraries or build steps

Prefer plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Comment non-obvious logic

Respect the existing tone and UI

If in doubt, open an issue before writing code.

**What will likely be declined**

Server-side features

User accounts or logins

Tracking-heavy analytics

Aggressive alerts or warnings

“Scam detection” framing

Anything that pressures the user toward a decision

HypeXray is a thinking aid, not a verdict engine.

**Style guidelines**

Neutral, non-accusatory language

No hype, fear, or urgency cues

Favor simple heuristics over complex logic

Keep UI text short and calm

**Licensing**

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.

**Code of conduct**

Be respectful.
Assume good intent.
Keep discussions focused on improving clarity.

Final note

HypeXray is designed to be useful even if it never grows large.

Thoughtful improvements matter more than scale.
